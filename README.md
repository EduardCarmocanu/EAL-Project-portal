# EAL-Project-portal
Simple CMS for learning purposes in the 3rd module of MMD at EAL Odense

The purpose of the CMS is to store and display uploaded student projects.

Due to the fact that it has been created in a very short period of time(5 days) it contains limited functionality but it is very easy to understand
and a begginer could use it as an example in order to understand how to work with PHP, JSON and how could you improve the UX with the help
of JavaScript.
In this case it is used for display file names in <label> elements in the upload page and on the home page for the side menu and search
function.

The PHP part is used for reusable components and storing and getting data. (Nothing fancy)
